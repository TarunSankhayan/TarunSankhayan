Hi there 👋

I am Tarun,a wannabe ML engineer based in India.

I build AI/ML models,nueral networks,system architectures.
I Design and create whatever i can.

If an idea pops into my head,chances are i'll build it and ship it.

🐍 Python                                                                                              *   Python,C/C++

🧠 Language Models & Neural Networks                                                                   *   Pytorch/TensorFlow

🌐 Computer Networks                                                                                   *   Networking fundamentals & protocols

⚙️ Low-Level Programming                                                                               *   System programming & architecture

🏗️ System Architectures                                                                                *   Linux systems


FUN FACTS:
*My GPU probably hates me but we’re in a long-term relationship.
*I judge programming languages by their error messages.
