Hi there 👋

I am Tarun, a wannabe ML engineer based in India.

I build AI/ML models, neural networks, system architectures.

I design and create whatever i can.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I'll build it and ship it.

* 🐍 Python
  
* 🧠 Language Models & Neural Networks

* 🌐 Computer Networks

* ⚙️ Low-Level Programming

* 🏗️ System Architectures


🔧 TECH & TOOLS I MESS WITH:

*   Python, C/C++

*   Pytorch/TensorFlow and other libraries

*   Networking fundamentals & protocols

*   Linux systems

💡 FUN FACTS:
* My GPU probably hates me but we’re in a long-term relationship.
* I judge programming languages by their error messages.
